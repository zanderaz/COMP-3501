# Assignment 4 Part B, COMP3501
### By Aidan, Evan, Zander

### Design
This code is designed to draw a geometry designed to look like veins or something anatomical like that. The l-system code provided on the brightspace was redesigned, adapted and used to create a string that will create a unique shape and also incorporates 3D 'movements'. This will be potentially adapted and improved for our final project.

### Build Instructions
1. Download your .zip file from Brightspace.
2. Unzip your .zip file into a new folder in /<of_folder_location>/apps/myApps/ .
3. Open /<of_folder_location>/projectGenerator/projectGenerator.exe
4. Click the "import" button and navigate to where you unzipped your submission in /myApps/ .
5. Click "Generate" (or if the button prompts change, click "Update").
6. projectGenerator.exe should now prompt you to open the project. Click the button "Open in IDE".
7. In Visual Studio 2022, run the project (click the green "play" button).
